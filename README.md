</div>

This repository is a school assignement.
This project is realised by Matthieu d'Hoop and Clément Dauriat.

## Subject

The project is to develop a front-end app that displays :
- a navigation bar with 
  - a link to products list
  - a link to users list
  - a link to orders list
  - a contact form

List are loaded from static json files stored in the backend.
Each list enables a click to a detail screen, showing the details of :
- a product
- a user
- an order

Contact form enables to enter an email and a message, with a button to send the message (an alert or a modal will be displayed with the content entered).

## Modalities

Project has to be done individually or by pair. 

### Technical stack

Front-end will be built using Angular.

An additional CSS lib can be used for a better design, but it is not mandatory.

### Deliverables

The expected deliverable will be a Git repo or a zip of your source code, with all your source files.

Send the URL of the Git repo or the zip by mail to your teacher thanks to Mootse.
